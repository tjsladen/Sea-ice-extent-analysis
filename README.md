# Arctic and Antarctic Sea Ice Extent Analysis

This project investigates historical trends and changes in sea ice extent across the Arctic and Antarctic using observational data and literature-based evidence. The report analyzes the structural, ecological, and climatic roles of sea ice and evaluates the effectiveness of current modelling approaches.

ðŸ“Œ Project Summary

    Objective: Understand the temporal evolution and geographic variability of sea ice extent from 1979â€“2024.

    Methods Used:

        Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) for time series trend analysis.

        Raster plots of sea ice concentration (1990 vs 2023).

        Comparative model evaluation (CMIP5 vs CMIP6).

    Tools & Data:

        Data from the NSIDC and Met Office Climate Dashboard.

        GAM implementation with holdout validation.

        Literature review of climate models and satellite remote sensing techniques.

ðŸ§Š Key Findings

    Arctic sea ice extent shows a consistent long-term decline, more easily modelled using time-based trends.

    Antarctic trends are less predictable, likely influenced more by oceanic and atmospheric processes.

    GAM models demonstrated stronger predictive performance in the Arctic (RÂ² â‰ˆ 0.76) than in the Antarctic (RÂ² â‰ˆ 0.49 holdout).

    Seasonal variability is more pronounced in the Antarctic, while spatial losses are more region-specific in the Arctic (e.g., North Atlantic exposure).

    CMIP6 models offered limited improvement over CMIP5 in replicating Antarctic trends.

ðŸ”¬ Limitations & Proposals

    Limitations:

        Data gaps due to satellite malfunctions.

        False positives in microwave detection of sea ice.

        Bias in global climate models for region-specific patterns.

    Proposed Solutions:

        Use of imputation for historical gaps.

        Regional models tailored to Arctic vs Antarctic conditions.

        Application of deep learning (e.g., CNNs) for model error correction and satellite image classification.
